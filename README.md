# Insect Detection and Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks

This repository contains the code, models, and resources for the masterâ€™s thesis project **"A Comparison of Convolutional Neural Network Architectures for Insect Detection of Different Sizes"**, completed as part of the Applied Data Science M.Sc. program at Carinthia University of Applied Sciences.

## Project Overview

This study evaluates several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, including YOLOv8, Faster R-CNN, and RetinaNet, to detect and classify insects in high-resolution images. The models were tested for general insect detection and for classification across six insect species, with a specific focus on handling small, occluded, or noisy insect images in natural habitats. This project aims to advance automated methods for ecological monitoring and pest management by exploring model performance in challenging environments.

## Research Goals

The primary objectives of this research include:
- Comparing the precision, F1 score, and mAP of various CNN models for insect detection.
- Investigating model robustness against environmental challenges, such as image noise, occlusion, and varying insect scales.
- Assessing the computational efficiency of models for practical applications in real-time monitoring.

## Methodology

1. **Data Acquisition**: Images were collected from camera traps set up in Carinthia, Austria, using high-resolution Ricoh WG-70 digital cameras. The dataset includes diverse insect species captured under varying environmental conditions.
2. **CNN Architectures**: YOLOv8, Faster R-CNN, and RetinaNet were chosen based on their success in object detection tasks. Each model was trained and evaluated on a labeled insect dataset containing over 1,300 images.
3. **Evaluation Metrics**: Model performance was measured through precision, recall, F1 score, and mean Average Precision (mAP), focusing on both general insect detection and classification at the species level.
